Requirements
Dia v0.97
Python 2.6 (Python 2.4 should work too)
Python modules

ConfigParser
Under Linux you can easily satisfy requirements with your actual packet manager or compiling from sources, under Windows have a look at Windows Dia installation documentation.

Installation
Download tarball or bzr branch from launchpad.net.

Put scriptlauncher.py and scriptlauncher dir and all its contents under ~/.dia/python (the python directory under the .dia directory in your home. If the python directory is not present, create it. Under Windows, should be something like C:\Documents and Settings\yourlogin\.dia\python or %USERPROFILE%/.dia/python, or have a look at Dia's FAQ).

All done.

Launch Dia and under Dialogs menu should find an entry named Script Launcher (as in screenshots).
Edit the scriptlauncher.cfg file (in scriptlauncher dir) with any kind of text editor to customize commands, create new ones at will.
